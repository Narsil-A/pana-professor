The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.
0:15
So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.
0:20
You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,
What is a vector
0:24
which I'll call the physics student perspective,
0:26
the computer science student perspective, and the mathematician's perspective.
0:30
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.
0:34
What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing,
0:38
but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around,
0:41
and it's still the same vector.
0:44
Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional,
0:46
and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.
0:51
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.
0:55
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices,
0:59
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.
1:03
You might model each house with a pair of numbers,
1:05
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.
1:09
Notice the order matters here.
1:12
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,
1:15
where in this context, vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list,
1:19
and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is two.
Coordinate system
1:25
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views,
1:29
basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding
1:33
two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number,
1:36
operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.
1:39
The details of this view are rather abstract, and I actually think it's healthy to ignore
1:43
it until the last video of this series, favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.
1:48
But the reason I bring it up here is that it hints at the
1:51
fact that the ideas of vector addition and multiplication by
1:54
numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.
1:58
But before I talk about those operations, let's just settle in
2:00
on a specific thought to have in mind when I say the word vector.
2:04
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,
2:07
whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors,
2:10
I want you to first think about an arrow, and specifically,
2:13
think about that arrow inside a coordinate system, like the xy-plane,
2:17
with its tail sitting at the origin.
2:19
This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective,
2:22
where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.
2:25
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case
2:27
that your vector will be rooted at the origin.
2:30
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space,
2:34
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view,
2:37
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.
2:41
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system,
2:45
it's worth walking through explicitly, since this is where all of the important
2:48
back and forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebra.
2:52
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment,
2:55
you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis.
3:00
The place where they intersect is called the origin,
3:02
which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.
3:06
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent one,
3:08
you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.
3:12
When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole,
3:14
which you'll see comes up a lot in these videos,
3:16
I'll extend these tick marks to make grid lines, but right now,
3:19
they'll actually get a little bit in the way.
3:22
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that basically gives
3:25
instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector at the origin to its tip.
3:30
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis,
3:34
positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward
3:38
motion, and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis
3:42
after that, positive numbers indicating upward motion,
3:45
and negative numbers indicating downward motion.
3:48
To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write
3:51
this pair of numbers vertically with square brackets around them.
3:56
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector,
3:59
and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.
4:04
What about in three dimensions?
4:06
Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,
4:08
which is perpendicular to both the x and y-axes, and in this case,
4:12
each vector is associated with ordered triplet of numbers.
4:16
The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis,
4:19
the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis,
4:23
and the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.
4:28
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space,
4:31
and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.
Vector addition
4:36
All right, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.
4:40
After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.
4:45
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define.
4:48
Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right,
4:51
and the other one pointing right and down a bit.
4:53
To add these two vectors, move the second one so
4:56
that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.
5:00
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to
5:04
where the tip of the second one sits, that new vector is their sum.
5:12
This definition of addition, by the way, is pretty much the only time
5:15
in linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.
5:19
Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do?
5:21
Why this definition of addition and not some other one?
5:25
Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement,
5:29
a step with a certain distance and direction in space.
5:33
If you take a step along the first vector, then take a step in the direction
5:37
and distance described by the second vector, the overall effect is just
5:41
the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.
5:45
You could think about this as an extension of
5:47
how we think about adding numbers on a number line.
5:50
One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2 plus 5,
5:53
is to think of moving two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.
5:57
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.
6:02
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.
6:06
The first vector here has coordinates 1, 2, and the second one has coordinates 3,
6:11
negative 1.
6:14
When you take the vector sum using this tip-to-tail method,
6:17
you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector.
6:21
Walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down.
6:26
Reorganizing these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion,
6:31
then do all the vertical motion, you can read it as saying first
6:35
move 1 plus 3 to the right, then move 2 minus 1 up.
6:40
So the new vector has coordinates 1 plus 3 and 2 plus negative 1.
6:45
In general, vector addition in this list of numbers conception
6:49
looks like matching up their terms and adding each one together.
Vector multiplication
6:54
The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.
6:58
Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.
7:01
If you take the number 2 and multiply it by a given vector,
7:04
it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.
7:10
If you multiply that vector by, say, one-third,
7:13
it means you squish it down so that it's one-third the original length.
7:17
When you multiply it by a negative number, like negative 1.8,
7:21
then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.
7:27
This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of
7:31
a vector is called scaling, and whenever you catch a number like two or one-third
7:36
or negative 1.8 acting like this, scaling some vector, you call it a scalar.
7:41
In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things that numbers do is scale
7:46
vectors, so it's common to use the word scalar pretty much interchangeably with the word
7:50
number.
7:52
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2,
7:55
corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor, 2.
8:00
So in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers,
8:03
multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each one of those
8:07
components by that scalar.
Conclusion
8:10
You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say linear algebra topics tend to
8:14
revolve around these two fundamental operations,
8:17
vector addition and scalar multiplication.
8:19
And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the
8:22
mathematician thinks only about these operations,
8:25
independent and abstracted away from however you choose to represent vectors.
8:29
In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows
8:33
in space, like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical
8:37
representation, or fundamentally as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric
8:41
interpretation.
8:42
The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these
8:46
views than it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them.
8:50
It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualize many lists
8:53
of numbers in a visual way, which can seriously clarify patterns
8:57
in data and give a global view of what certain operations do.
9:00
And on the flip side, it gives people like physicists and computer
9:04
graphics programmers a language to describe space and the manipulation
9:07
of space using numbers that can be crunched and run through a computer.
9:12
When I do math-y animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's
9:15
actually going on in space, and then get the computer to represent things numerically,
9:20
thereby figuring out where to place the pixels on the screen.
9:23
And doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra understanding.
9:27
So there are your vector basics, and in the next video I'll
9:35
start getting into some pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors like span,
9:45
bases, and linear dependence. See you then! you
