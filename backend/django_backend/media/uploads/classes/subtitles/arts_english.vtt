00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.045
Imagine you and a friend are 
strolling through an art exhibit

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.655
and a striking painting catches your eye.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:22.085
The vibrant red appears to you 
as a symbol of love,

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.445
but your friend is convinced 
it's a symbol of war.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:28.955
And where you see stars in a romantic sky,

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:33.787
your friend interprets global 
warming-inducing pollutants.

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:37.407
To settle the debate, you turn to the
internet, where you read

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:41.907
that the painting is a replica of 
the artist's first-grade art project:

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:46.746
Red was her favorite color 
and the silver dots are fairies.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:51.328
You now know the exact intentions 
that led to the creation of this work.

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:55.398
Are you wrong to have enjoyed it 
as something the artist didn’t intend?

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:58.918
Do you enjoy it less now 
that you know the truth?

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:01.038
Just how much should 
the artist's intention

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.328
affect your interpretation 
of the painting?

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.278
It's a question that's been tossed around

00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:11.778
by philosophers and art critics for 
decades, with no consensus in sight.

00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:13.479
In the mid-20th century,

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.989
literary critic W.K. Wimsatt and 
philosopher Monroe Beardsley

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:21.359
argued that artistic 
intention was irrelevant.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.829
They called this the Intentional Fallacy:

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.149
the belief that valuing an artist's 
intentions was misguided.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.269
Their argument was twofold:

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.549
First, the artists we study are 
no longer living,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.449
never recorded their intentions,

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.599
or are simply unavailable to answer 
questions about their work.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:44.157
Second, even if there were a bounty 
of relevant information,

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:45.597
Wimsatt and Beardsley believed

00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:49.087
it would distract us from the 
qualities of the work itself.

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.227
They compared art to a dessert:

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.767
When you taste a pudding,

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:57.337
the chef's intentions don't affect whether
you enjoy its flavor or texture.

00:01:57.337 --> 00:02:01.597
All that matters, they said, 
is that the pudding "works."

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:05.677
Of course, what "works" for one person 
might not "work" for another.

00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:09.018
And since different interpretations 
appeal to different people,

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:13.268
the silver dots in our painting could be 
reasonably interpreted as fairies,

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:15.510
stars, or pollutants.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.660
By Wimsatt and Beardsley's logic, the
artist's interpretation of her own work

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.550
would just be one among many equally
acceptable possibilities.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.202
If you find this problematic,

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:30.292
you might be more in line with Steven 
Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels,

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:34.072
two literary theorists who rejected the
Intentional Fallacy.

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:36.462
They argued that an artist's 
intended meaning

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:39.052
was not just one possible interpretation,

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:41.802
but the only possible interpretation.

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.492
For example, suppose you're 
walking along a beach

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:49.012
and come across a series of marks in the 
sand that spell out a verse of poetry.

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:52.221
Knapp and Michaels believed the 
poem would lose all meaning

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.691
if you discovered these marks were not 
the work of a human being,

00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.471
but an odd coincidence 
produced by the waves.

00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.421
They believed an intentional creator

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:04.591
is what makes the poem subject to 
understanding at all.

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:06.928
Other thinkers advocate for 
a middle ground,

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:11.818
suggesting that intention is just one 
piece in a larger puzzle.

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:15.258
Contemporary philosopher Noel Carroll 
took this stance,

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:18.928
arguing that an artist's intentions are 
relevant to their audience

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.658
the same way a speaker's intentions

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:24.158
are relevant to the person they’re 
engaging in conversation.

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:27.098
To understand how intentions function 
in conversation,

00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:31.208
Carroll said to imagine someone holding
a cigarette and asking for a match.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.201
You respond by handing them a lighter,

00:03:33.201 --> 00:03:36.251
gathering that their motivation is to 
light their cigarette.

00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.102
The words they used to ask the question 
are important,

00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:43.472
but the intentions behind the question 
dictate your understanding and ultimately,

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:45.492
your response.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.518
So which end of this spectrum 
do you lean towards?

00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:52.258
Do you, like Wimsatt and Beardsley, 
believe that when it comes to art,

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:53.998
the proof should be in the pudding?

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:57.688
Or do you think that an artist's plans 
and motivations for their work

00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.348
affect its meaning?

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:02.108
Artistic interpretation is a complex web

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:06.158
that will probably never offer 
a definitive answer.
