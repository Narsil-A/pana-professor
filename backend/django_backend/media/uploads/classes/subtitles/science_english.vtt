00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:10.006
Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny,

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.176
you might show your teeth,
change your breathing,

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:17.555
become weak and achy in some places,
and maybe even cry?

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:23.311
In other words, why do we do
this bizarre thing that is laughter?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.441
When you laugh, your abdominal muscles
contract rapidly.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.401
This alters your breathing patterns,

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:34.489
increasing the pressure in your
chest cavity, and pushing air out,

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.285
which might audibly emerge as a snort,
wheeze, or vocalization.

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.039
Because you’re exerting your abdominal
muscles much more

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.249
than you usually would while talking,

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.876
they may start to hurt.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:51.214
Laughter also inhibits your reflexes
and muscle control,

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:54.050
causing sensations like leg weakness.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.553
So, where does this funny phenomenon
come from?

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:01.808
Because there’s no archaeological
record of laughter,

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:06.229
it’s impossible to say exactly how and why
it evolved,

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.773
but scientists have some theories.

00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:13.194
Importantly, humans are not
the only animals today

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.196
that do something like laughter.

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:17.824
Using ultrasonic recorders,

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:23.663
researchers in the late 90s realized
that rats were basically giggling

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:25.081
while being tickled.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:30.920
Scientists have since compiled evidence
of at least 65 species—

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:36.551
mostly mammals, but also some birds—
that vocalize during social play.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.638
Some, unsurprisingly,
are our closest relatives.

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:44.225
By recording and analyzing the sounds
primates make

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.185
while playing and being tickled,

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:50.857
researchers grew more convinced that
the ancient ancestor of all great apes

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:52.733
did something like laughter.

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:57.405
And, because other apes make laughter-like
sounds during rough-and-tumble play,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.784
they think laughter may have originally
developed to clearly signal

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:04.328
friendly, non-aggressive intent.

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:09.792
But of course, humans don’t just laugh
when we’re wrestling,

00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:16.090
but also when we’re amused,
and even surprised, confused, or nervous.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.011
Some scientists think laughter took
on expanded functions

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.471
after humans split from other great apes

00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:26.726
and developed large social groups
and more complex language abilities.

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:30.771
They hypothesize that laughter gradually
became something we could use

00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:35.735
not just during play but within speech
to convey subtle meanings

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:39.655
and a range of contexts
to show our emotions.

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:45.286
This is thought to be one of the reasons
that laughter is contagious:

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:49.165
it’s like an invitation to share
in someone’s emotional state.

00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:54.545
Just hearing clips of laughter can
activate key regions in your brain,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.715
triggering you to smile or laugh yourself.

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:01.636
And, when participants in one study
watched a funny video,

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:04.931
they laughed significantly longer
and more often

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.724
when another person was present—

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:10.853
even though they reported feeling
the same level of amusement.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.815
Human laughter is also generally louder

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:17.860
than the play vocalizations
of most animals.

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:22.657
Some scientists speculate that this
is because our laughter functions

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:28.788
not only as a signal between individuals,
but a broadcast to everyone around.

00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:35.127
Studies found that observers across the
world and as young as 5 months old

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:39.548
could reliably tell the difference
between close friends and acquaintances

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:42.677
just from brief clips of them laughing.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.225
Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh
is real or fake based just on the sound.

00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:51.894
Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced

00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:54.689
in entirely different networks
in the brain,

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.149
relying on speech-like pathways.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:02.321
Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises
from older networks

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.200
that other animals also use
for their vocalizations.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.578
And laughter is not just
socially important;

00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:12.206
it’s also thought to be good for us.

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:16.419
When we laugh, our brains release
feel-good neurotransmitters

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.712
like endorphins,

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:21.549
and decrease levels of stress hormones
like cortisol.

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.469
Some research even suggests that people
who laugh more

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.266
can cope with stress more effectively
and have better cardiovascular health.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:34.520
Laughter is a universal human behavior.

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:37.523
Babies can laugh before they can speak.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:41.569
Whether it's the best medicine
depends on your ailment.

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:44.363
But as something that makes
life more tolerable,

00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:48.951
strengthens bonds, and potentially
improves aspects of your health,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.620
you can’t go wrong with a good laugh.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:54.582
Unless you have a broken rib or something.

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:56.667
Then it’s no laughing matter.

00:04:56.792 --> 00:05:00.004
Certainly nothing to crack up about.
