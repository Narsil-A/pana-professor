00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.220
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block for linear algebra is the vector.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.840
So it's worth making sure that we're all on the same page about what exactly a vector is.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.277
You see, broadly speaking, there are three distinct but related ideas about vectors,

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:26.523
which I'll call the physics student perspective,

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:30.100
the computer science student perspective, and the mathematician's perspective.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.400
The physics student perspective is that vectors are arrows pointing in space.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.384
What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing,

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.736
but as long as those two facts are the same, you can move it all around,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.160
and it's still the same vector.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.536
Vectors that live in the flat plane are two-dimensional,

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:50.040
and those sitting in broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.640
The computer science perspective is that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.326
For example, let's say you were doing some analytics about house prices,

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.760
and the only features you cared about were square footage and price.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.445
You might model each house with a pair of numbers,

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:08.680
the first indicating square footage and the second indicating price.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.040
Notice the order matters here.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.912
In the lingo, you'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors,

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:19.740
where in this context, vector is pretty much just a fancy word for list,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.040
and what makes it two-dimensional is the fact that the length of that list is two.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.349
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks to generalize both these views,

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.694
basically saying that a vector can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:36.135
two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number,

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:38.820
operations that I'll talk about later on in this video.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.806
The details of this view are rather abstract, and I actually think it's healthy to ignore

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:47.940
it until the last video of this series, favoring a more concrete setting in the interim.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.226
But the reason I bring it up here is that it hints at the

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.198
fact that the ideas of vector addition and multiplication by

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:57.220
numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.972
But before I talk about those operations, let's just settle in

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:04.040
on a specific thought to have in mind when I say the word vector.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.551
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting for here,

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:10.258
whenever I introduce a new topic involving vectors,

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.381
I want you to first think about an arrow, and specifically,

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.025
think about that arrow inside a coordinate system, like the xy-plane,

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.900
with its tail sitting at the origin.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.549
This is a little bit different from the physics student perspective,

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.920
where vectors can freely sit anywhere they want in space.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.896
In linear algebra, it's almost always the case

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:30.320
that your vector will be rooted at the origin.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.606
Then, once you understand a new concept in the context of arrows in space,

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.637
we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view,

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:40.620
which we can do by considering the coordinates of the vector.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.198
Now, while I'm sure that many of you are already familiar with this coordinate system,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.655
it's worth walking through explicitly, since this is where all of the important

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:51.680
back and forth happens between the two perspectives of linear algebra.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.466
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for the moment,

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:59.580
you have a horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a vertical line, called the y-axis.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.404
The place where they intersect is called the origin,

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:05.520
which you should think of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.715
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent one,

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:11.360
you make tick marks on each axis to represent this distance.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.654
When I want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole,

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.733
which you'll see comes up a lot in these videos,

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.450
I'll extend these tick marks to make grid lines, but right now,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.360
they'll actually get a little bit in the way.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.757
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that basically gives

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:30.160
instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector at the origin to its tip.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.004
The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.256
positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:42.303
motion, and the second number tells you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:45.121
after that, positive numbers indicating upward motion,

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.580
and negative numbers indicating downward motion.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.191
To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:54.340
this pair of numbers vertically with square brackets around them.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.660
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.680
and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.500
What about in three dimensions?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.970
Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.920
which is perpendicular to both the x and y-axes, and in this case,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.339
each vector is associated with ordered triplet of numbers.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.903
The first tells you how far to move along the x-axis,

00:04:19.903 --> 00:04:23.340
the second tells you how far to move parallel to the y-axis,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.680
and the third one tells you how far to then move parallel to this new z-axis.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.869
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique vector in space,

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:35.560
and every vector in space gives you exactly one triplet of numbers.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.100
All right, so back to vector addition and multiplication by numbers.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.780
After all, every topic in linear algebra is going to center around these two operations.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.640
Luckily, each one's pretty straightforward to define.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.561
Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right,

00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:53.560
and the other one pointing right and down a bit.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.879
To add these two vectors, move the second one so

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.680
that its tail sits at the tip of the first one.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.456
Then, if you draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:08.740
where the tip of the second one sits, that new vector is their sum.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.569
This definition of addition, by the way, is pretty much the only time

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.860
in linear algebra where we let vectors stray away from the origin.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.480
Now, why is this a reasonable thing to do?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.020
Why this definition of addition and not some other one?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.995
Well, the way I like to think about it is that each vector represents a certain movement,

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:32.680
a step with a certain distance and direction in space.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.709
If you take a step along the first vector, then take a step in the direction

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.196
and distance described by the second vector, the overall effect is just

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:44.780
the same as if you moved along the sum of those two vectors to start with.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.251
You could think about this as an extension of

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:49.460
how we think about adding numbers on a number line.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.521
One way that we teach kids to think about this, say with 2 plus 5,

00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:57.960
is to think of moving two steps to the right followed by another five steps to the right.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.720
The overall effect is the same as if you just took seven steps to the right.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.480
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks numerically.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.698
The first vector here has coordinates 1, 2, and the second one has coordinates 3,

00:06:11.698 --> 00:06:12.460
negative 1.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.343
When you take the vector sum using this tip-to-tail method,

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:21.420
you can think of a four-step path from the origin to the tip of the second vector.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.620
Walk 1 to the right, then 2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.341
Reorganizing these steps so that you first do all of the rightward motion,

00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.173
then do all the vertical motion, you can read it as saying first

00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:38.180
move 1 plus 3 to the right, then move 2 minus 1 up.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.920
So the new vector has coordinates 1 plus 3 and 2 plus negative 1.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.122
In general, vector addition in this list of numbers conception

00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:52.700
looks like matching up their terms and adding each one together.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.360
The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.380
Now this is best understood just by looking at a few examples.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.994
If you take the number 2 and multiply it by a given vector,

00:07:04.994 --> 00:07:09.620
it means you stretch out that vector so that it's two times as long as when you started.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.065
If you multiply that vector by, say, one-third,

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:16.860
it means you squish it down so that it's one-third the original length.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.317
When you multiply it by a negative number, like negative 1.8,

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:26.300
then the vector first gets flipped around, then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.991
This process of stretching or squishing or sometimes reversing the direction of

00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:36.739
a vector is called scaling, and whenever you catch a number like two or one-third

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:41.140
or negative 1.8 acting like this, scaling some vector, you call it a scalar.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.252
In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of the main things that numbers do is scale

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:50.820
vectors, so it's common to use the word scalar pretty much interchangeably with the word

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.180
number.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.540
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a factor of, say, 2,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.580
corresponds with multiplying each of its components by that factor, 2.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.115
So in the conception of vectors as lists of numbers,

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:07.098
multiplying a given vector by a scalar means multiplying each one of those

00:08:07.098 --> 00:08:08.480
components by that scalar.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.644
You'll see in the following videos what I mean when I say linear algebra topics tend to

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:17.108
revolve around these two fundamental operations,

00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:19.220
vector addition and scalar multiplication.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.879
And I'll talk more in the last video about how and why the

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.336
mathematician thinks only about these operations,

00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:29.120
independent and abstracted away from however you choose to represent vectors.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.866
In truth, it doesn't matter whether you think about vectors as fundamentally being arrows

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:37.255
in space, like I'm suggesting you do, that happen to have a nice numerical

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:41.322
representation, or fundamentally as lists of numbers that happen to have a nice geometric

00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:42.000
interpretation.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.024
The usefulness of linear algebra has less to do with either one of these

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:49.720
views than it does with the ability to translate back and forth between them.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.590
It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualize many lists

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.041
of numbers in a visual way, which can seriously clarify patterns

00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:00.280
in data and give a global view of what certain operations do.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.205
And on the flip side, it gives people like physicists and computer

00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:07.792
graphics programmers a language to describe space and the manipulation

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:11.380
of space using numbers that can be crunched and run through a computer.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.918
When I do math-y animations, for example, I start by thinking about what's

00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:20.116
actually going on in space, and then get the computer to represent things numerically,

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:23.060
thereby figuring out where to place the pixels on the screen.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.580
And doing that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra understanding.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:35.702
So there are your vector basics, and in the next video I'll

00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:45.661
start getting into some pretty neat concepts surrounding vectors like span,

00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:51.820
bases, and linear dependence. See you then! you
