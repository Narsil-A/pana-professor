Are you anxious about learning to code?

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.034
Feeling overwhelmed?

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:13.014
I was too when I started.

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:16.413
Picking a programming language
can feel like a word soup--

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:18.901
it's hard to know where to start.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.464
So, in 60 seconds, I'm going to explain
what a programming language is

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.108
and why you don't need to stress
too much about picking one.

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:28.928
A programming language
is a specific human-readable way

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.250
of telling a computer what to do.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.058
For instance, if I said,
"Hey, computer, count to five,"

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:36.772
it wouldn't know what to do.

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:40.969
But if I used a programming language
to send instructions to a computer,

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.321
I can get it to do all sorts of things,

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.995
including counting to five.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:48.671
A programming language
is built out of a series of symbols,

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.109
where symbols represent
a precise instruction for the computer.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.368
These symbols combined
create a computer program,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.594
which is a set of instructions
for a computer to follow.

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:00.339
When learning to code,

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.921
you'll need to understand
basic coding concepts

00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:05.645
that are shared between
all programming languages.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:09.120
But some languages
make certain things easier to do.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.672
A language like JavaScript is used
to make websites interactive.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.949
Languages like Python and C++

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.250
make it easier to write algorithms
and storage systems.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.368
So, which language should you learn?

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.154
There's no wrong answer.

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:25.452
The most important thing is to learn
general programming concepts

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.003
so you can code in any situation.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.943
If you're interested in learning
general coding principles,

00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:32.272
check out Grasshopper--

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:35.403
a free mobile app that teaches you
to code from scratch.

00:01:35.403 --> 00:01:38.895
Or consider enrolling in any
of Google's Developer Training classes.
